    <p id="description"> "Tech is the present and the future." <br> <br> I lived through a time as a young boy where touch screen phones where new to the world and social media was not identified as part of our identity, neither was it a part of our daily lives. As time went by we started seeing the dominance the emerging technological advances had on our lives, even effecting the way we work and the types of jobs existent across the globe which where not around just some years ago. My dreams changed as technology evolved. <br> <br>
      As the world around me changed so did my desires. I grew a strong interest in tech and started learning more about it. I realised how vital Tech for the present day and how vital it will be for the future too. This thought led me onto taking courses online and self teaching myself about coding and trying to get into tech overall. I often watch videos online on areas of tech I am interested in and have long conversations with friends who also have an interest in the tech. <br>
      I want to be a part of the future and hence I really look forward to learning all I can, and doing all I can in the field of tech. It's fascinating and incredible to think that lines of code could be the main source or have enough power to assist aeroplanes, cars and even fields such as EdTech, FinTech, HealthTech and many more. I find myself growing more and more eager to learning about tech and hopefully I will soon be where I want.
      My interest in tech was triggered by many things including interesting videos I'd see online, one of which I'd like to share just below. </p>
